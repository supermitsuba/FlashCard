Flash Card project
============================

In order to study, I wanted to create a flash card app.  What I didnt want to do was load a server in the cloud.  Thats where gomix comes in, they allow you to host your prototype site for free.  Pretty cool. 


Features
--------

On the back-end,
- npm install
- set port number for the environment
- node server.js
- visit url

On the front-end,
- Five it a url to a csv file.  
   - The file must have 2 columns, question and answer
- Everything is saved locally, so you can use flash cards online and offline
- This all will be saved to the localstorage of the browser.
- If you want to wipe out your data, just click the big red reset button
- If that doesnt work, clear your browser cache
- have fun
